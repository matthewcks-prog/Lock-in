# Lock-in Repo Steward (DEPRECATED)

> **DEPRECATED** — This file is deprecated. Use `/AGENTS.md` + `docs/*` instead.

## Migration Guide

The documentation has been reorganized for better maintainability:

- **`/AGENTS.md`** - Canonical stable contract: architecture boundaries, coding rules, workflow patterns
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Stable architecture documentation (when created)
- **`docs/STATUS.md`** - Current snapshot: outstanding issues, recent changes, implementation status
- **`docs/REPO_MAP.md`** - Repository structure map (when created)
- **`docs/ADRS/`** - Architecture Decision Records (when created)
- **`docs/REFACTOR_PLAN.md`** - Phased refactoring plan
- **`docs/PROMPT_LOG.md`** - Log of refactoring prompts and outcomes
- **`CODE_OVERVIEW.md`** - Current codebase snapshot (implementation details)
- **`DATABASE.MD`** - Database schema and migration history

## Quick Links
