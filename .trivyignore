# Trivy Ignore File

# This file lists CVEs that are known but cannot be fixed immediately

# Format: CVE-ID or vulnerability ID per line

#

# IMPORTANT: Each ignored vulnerability should have:

# 1. A comment explaining why it's ignored

# 2. A link to the tracking issue or upstream fix

# 3. An expiration date for review

#

# Best Practice: Review this file monthly and remove fixed vulnerabilities

# Alpine base image vulnerabilities - waiting for upstream fixes

# These are in the base OS, not our code or direct dependencies

# Review: 2026-02-20

# Add specific CVEs here as needed after reviewing Trivy reports

# Example format:

# CVE-2024-12345 # Brief description - expires 2026-02-01
